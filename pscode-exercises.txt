// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input the number
    PRINT "Enter a number:"
    INPUT number
 Check if the number is even or odd
    IF (number % 2 == 0) THEN
        PRINT "The number is even."
    ELSE
        PRINT "The number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input 5 separate numbers
PRINT "enter first number:"
input num1
print "enter the second number:"
input num2
print "enter the third number:"
input num3
print "enter the fourth number:"
input num4
print "enter the fifth number:"
input num5

sum= num1+num2+num3+num4+num5

sum / 5

Find the smallest and largest
    smallest = num1
    largest = num1
    IF num2 < smallest THEN
        smallest = num2
    END IF
    IF num2 > largest THEN
        largest = num2
repeat steps for num3. num4, num5.
